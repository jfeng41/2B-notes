\section*{MATH 239 Summary Sheet}

\subsection*{Graphs}
\begineasylist

# $V(G)$ = set of \textbf{vertices} in the graph $G$

# $E(G)$ = set of \textbf{edges} in the graph $G$

# ``$k$-regular graph'' = every vertex has degree $k$

# ``Complete graph'' ($K_n$) = all vertices are adjacent; i.e. $(n-1)$-regular

# ``Complete bipartite graph'' ($K_{m,n}$) = all vertices in one partition are adjacent to all vertices in other partition

# \textbf{Handshaking Lemma:} 
\[ \sum_{v \in V(G)} deg(v) = 2 |E(G)| \]

\end{easylist}
\subsection*{Paths and Cycles}
\begineasylist

# \textbf{Theorem:} $\exists$ a \underline{walk} between $u,v$ in $G$ $\implies$ $\exists$ a \underline{path} between $u,v$ in $G$ 

## \textbf{Corollary:} $\exists$ a path between $x,y$ AND $\exists$ a path between $y,z$ $\implies$ $\exists$ a path between $x,z$

# \textbf{Theorem:} every vertex in $G$ has degree $\geq 2$ $\implies$ $G$ contains a cycle

\end{easylist}
\subsection*{Connectedness}
\begineasylist

# Fix vertex $v$ in $G$; 
## $\forall$ vertex $w$ in $G$, $\exists$ path between $v,w$ $\implies$ $G$ is \textbf{connected}

# Let $X \subset V(G)$;
## ``Cut induced by $X$'' = set of edges with exactly one vertex $\in X$
## \textbf{Theorem:} $G$ is \underline{not connected} $\iff$ $\exists$ $X$ such that cut induced by $X$ is empty

# ``Eulerian circuit'' = closed walk that contains every edge exactly once

# \textbf{Theorem:} $G$ has Eulerian circuit $\iff$ $G$ is connected AND every vertex has even degree

# \textbf{Lemma:} $G$ is connected AND $e$ is a bridge $\implies$ $G - e$ has exactly 2 components

# \textbf{Theorem:} $e$ is a bridge $\iff$ $e$ is not contained in any cycle

## \textbf{Corollary:} $\exists$ 2 distinct paths between $u,v$ in $G$ $\implies$ $G$ contains a cycle

\end{easylist}
\subsection*{Trees}
\begineasylist

# ``Tree'' = \underline{connected graph} with \underline{no cycles}

# ``Leaf'' = vertex in a tree with degree 1

# Let $T$ be a tree;

## \textbf{Lemma:} $\exists$ a unique path between every $u,v$ in $T$ 

## \textbf{Lemma:} every edge in $T$ is a bridge

## \textbf{Theorem:} $T$ has $\geq 2$ vertices $\implies$ $T$ has $\geq 2$ leaves

## \textbf{Theorem:} $|E(T)| = |V(T)| - 1$

# \textbf{Theorem:} $G$ is connected $\iff$ $G$ has a spanning tree

## \textbf{Corollary:} $G$ is connected AND $G$ has $p$ vertices and $q = p-1$ edges $\implies$ $G$ is a tree

# \textbf{Theorem:} $T$ is a spanning tree of $G$ AND $e$ is an edge $\notin T$  $\implies$ $T + e$ contains exactly 1 cycle $C$
## Also: $e'$ is an edge $\in C$ $\implies$ $T + e - e'$ is also a spanning tree of $G$

\end{easylist}
\subsection*{Bipartites}
\begineasylist

# \textbf{Theorem:} all trees are bipartite

# \textbf{Theorem:} $G$ is bipartite $\iff$ $G$ contains no \underline{odd cycles}

\end{easylist}
\subsection*{Minimum Spanning Tree}
\begineasylist

# \textbf{Prim's Algorithm:}
## Begin with a vertex in $G$ and add it to $T$
## At each step, find the \underline{lowest-weight edge} that joins a vertex in $T$ with a vertex not in $T$
## Follow this edge and add the vertex to $T$; repeat
