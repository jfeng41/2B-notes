# Order notations
## $f(n) \in O(g(n))$ if $\exists \ c > 0$ and $n_0 > 0$ such that $0 \leq f(n) \leq cg(n) \ \forall \ n \geq n_0$
### $f$ ``grows no faster than'' $g$ ($\leq$)

## $f(n) \in \Omega(g(n))$ if $\exists \ c > 0$ and $n_0 > 0$ such that $0 \leq cg(n) \leq f(n) \ \forall \ n \geq n_0$
### $f$ ``grows no slower than'' $g$ ($\geq$)

### If $L = \infty$ then $f \in \omega(g)$

## If $f \in O(g)$ and $f \in \Omega(g)$, then $f \in \Theta(g)$

# Loop analysis
## Begin from the innermost nested loop; use $\sum$ for each outer loop

# Recurrence relations analysis
## \textbf{In general}, $\{T(n) = T(n/2) + c\} \in \Theta(\log n)$

\text{Let } n &= 2^k, \text{i.e. } k = \log n\\
T(2^k) &= T(2^{k-1}) + c\\
&= T(2^{k-2}) + 2c\\
&= \ldots\\
&= T(2^0) + kc\\
&= c + (\log n)c\\

\subsection*{Priorty Queues and Heaps}
\begineasylist

# \textbf{Priority queue}: an \textbf{abstract data type} containing a collection of items each with a priority

# \textbf{Heap}: binary tree with 2 properties
## Structural property: all levels of filled except the lowest, which is left-justified
## Ordering property: the parent of any node has greater value than the node itself

# The height of a heap with $n$ nodes is $\Theta(\log n)$
## Since $2^k \leq n$ (\# of nodes on all levels above) and $n \leq 2^{k+1} - 1$ (\# of nodes including this level)

# \textbf{Bubble-up algorithm}: used for heap \underline{insertion}
## If node.key $>$ node.parent.key then swap
## Brings a \underline{large} value from a leaf node \underline{up}

# \textbf{Bubble-down algorithm}: used for heap \underline{deletion}
## If node.key $<$ node.largest\_child.key then swap
## Brings a \underline{small} value from the root node \underline{down}

# Heapify with bubble-up: insert each item, total runtime = $\Theta(n \log n)$

# Heapify with bubble-down (given an unordered array): since leaf nodes can't bubble-down, start bubbling down from second-last level up ($n/2$ nodes)
## Total runtime = $\Theta(n)$

# \textbf{Heapsort}: heap-insert $n$ times (or just heaptify), then delete-max $n$ times -- always $\Theta(n \log n)$
## \underline{Not stable}


\end{easylist}
\subsection*{Sorting, Selection, Randomized Algorithms}
\begineasylist

# A sorting algorithm is \underline{stable} if the order of equal (tied) keys are preserved (from the original order in the input)

# \textbf{Selection problem}: find the $k$-th largest element within $n$ elements

# \textbf{Quickselect}:
## Choose pivot = $\Theta(1)$
## Partition:
### Go from outermost pair inwards, swap any pairs that are in the wrong order ($\Theta(n)$)
### Return index of pivot; array is now partitioned by the pivot value
## Recursively call partition on one of the two partitions, until pivot index = desired index (like binary search)

## Worse case: every recursive call paritions off 1 element =  $\Theta(n^2)$
## Best case: desired element is returned on first call = $\Theta(n)$

# \textbf{Quicksort}:
## Same as quickselect, except recurse on both partitions instead of just one
## Worse case = $\Theta(n^2)$
## Best case = average case = $\Theta(n \log n)$
## \underline{Not stable}

# \textbf{Randomized algorithm}: algorithm whose output depends on the input as well as some random numbers
## $T(I, R) = $ runtime given input $I$ and set of random numbers $R$
## \textbf{Expected runtime} = $T^{exp} (I) = \sum_R T(I, R) \times P(R)$
### For uniform distribution, $P(R) = 1/$\# possibilities generated by $R$
## For quickselect and quicksort, randomizing the pivot makes the expected time = average time

## \textbf{Monte Carlo algorithm}: always fast, not always correct
## \textbf{Las Vegas algorithm}: always correct, not always fast

# \textbf{Comparison model}: 
## Data can only be accessed by:
### Comparing two elements
### Moving elements around

## \textbf{Theorem}: any correct comparison-based sorting algorithm is $\Omega(n \log n)$

# \textbf{Countsort}: input of size $n$ only contains numbers in a consecutive range of size $k$
## Count the \# of occurrences of each element (i.e. a histogram)
## Place elements back into array in-order, based on their \# of occurrences
## $\in \Theta(n + k) \in \Theta(n)$ if $k \in O(n)$
## \underline{Is stable}

# \textbf{Radix sort}: represent all elements in base $r$ (radix)
## Sort by each digit (count sort), starting from most/least significant digit ($m$ digits)
## $\in \Theta(m(n+r)) \in \Theta(n)$ if $m, r \in O(n)$
## MSD is \underline{not stable}, LSD is \underline{stable}


\end{easylist}
\subsection*{Balanced Search Trees}
\begineasylist

# \textbf{Binary search tree}
## Left[right] subtree nodes $<$[$>$] root node
## Search, insert = $\Theta(\log n)$
## Delete = $\Theta(\log n)$
### If is leaf, just delete
### If has one child, replace with child
### If has two children, swap with \emph{predecessor} or \emph{successor} then delete
## Worse-case height = $\Theta(n)$

# \textbf{AVL tree}
## \textbf{Balance} of each node = height(right subtree) -- height(left subtree)
## Height of empty subtree = --1
## If $|$balance$|$ $>$ 1, tree is out of balance
## \textbf{Right/left rotation}: when node balance = $\pm2$ and a child has balance = $\pm1$ of the same sign
## \textbf{Double right/left rotation}: when node balance = $\pm2$ and a child has balance = $\pm1$ of the opposite sign
## Rotations are $\Theta(1)$
## Insert \& delete normally as in BSTs, update balances from bottom up and rotate if any subtree is out of balance ($\Theta(\log n)$)
## \# of nodes in a subtree of a given height is at least = $N(h) = 1 + N(h-1) + N(h-2) \geq 2N(h-2)$
### From this recurrence we get $N(h) \geq 2^{\lfloor h/2 \rfloor}$ or $h \in O(\log n)$
## \# of nodes is also at most $N(h) = 2^{h+1} - 1$, or $h \in \Omega(\log n)$
## Therefore the height of an AVL tree is $\Theta(\log n)$

\end{easylist}
\subsection*{Dictionaries}
\begineasylist

# \textbf{Dictionary}: a collection of \textbf{key-value pairs} (KVP)
# \textbf{Optimal static ordering}: elements are stored in decreasing order by probability of access
## Given $L$ of $n$ elements, expected access cost is $E(L) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i)T(x_i) $
## If $P$ is uniform then $E(L) = \sum_{i=1}^n \dfrac{i}{n} \in \Theta(n)$

# \textbf{Dynamic ordering}: 
## \textbf{Move-to-front (MTF)}: move searched item to the front of list
## Transpose: swap searched item with item preceding it

# \textbf{Skip list}:
## A series of lists $S_0 \ldots S_h$ containing keys in increasing order
### Each starts and ends special keys $-\infty$ and $+\infty$
### Each level contains a subset of the level below; i.e. $S_h \subseteq S_{h-1} \subseteq \ldots \subseteq S_0 $
### $S_h$ only contains $-\infty$ and $+\infty$

## Skip search: navigate down and to the right from the top-left
### Peek ahead on current level; if went over target, descend one level

## Height of an inserted element is \underline{randomly computed}
### e.g. height = $k$ = \# of heads flipped before a tail
### $P(\text{height = }k) = (1/2)^k$
### Expected \# of nodes on level $k$ is $\dfrac{n}{2^k}$
### Expected total \# of nodes for $C$ levels is $\sum_{k=0}^C \dfrac{n}{2^k} = 2n$ as $C \rightarrow \infty$
## Expected space = $O(n)$
## Expected height = $O(\log n)$
## Expected search, insert, delete = $O(\log n)$


\end{easylist}
\subsection*{Tries}
\begineasylist

# \textbf{(Binary) Trie/radix tree}: a bitwise binary tree
## Left child = 0, right child = 1
## A node is flagged if the \underline{binary string generated by the path from root to it} is in the dictionary
## Insert: search for node
### If it exists, flag it
### If not, extend from last matching node by creating new nodes
## Delete: search for node
### If it's not a leaf, unflag it
### If it's a leaf, delete it and all ancestors until a \underline{flagged node} or \underline{node with 2 children} is reached 
## Search, insert, delete $\in \Theta(h) = \Theta(|x|)$ where $|x|$ = \# of bits

# \textbf{Compressed trie/Patricia trie}
## Reduce each path through unflagged nodes with one child to a single edge
## Each node stores the next index/digit to be tested
## Time complexity same as uncompressed; \underline{space complexity is improved}


\end{easylist}
\subsection*{Hashing}
\begineasylist

# \textbf{Theorem}: any comparison-based search on a size-$n$ dictionary is $\Omega(\log n)$
# \textbf{Direct addressing}:
## Each key $k$ is integer $0 \leq k < M$ for some $M$
## Each value $v$ corresponding to $k$ is stored at $A[k]$
## Search, insert, delete $\in \Theta(1)$
## Total storage $\in \Theta(n)$

# \textbf{Hash function} = $h : U \rightarrow \{0, 1, \ldots, M - 1\}$
## Any key $k \in U$ is mapped to some index in an array of size $M$ (a \underline{hash table})
## i.e. value $v$ for key $k$ is stored at $A[h(k)]$

# \textbf{Load factor} = $\alpha = \dfrac{n}{M}$
## If load factor is too high/too low, increase/decrease $M$ and \underline{rehash}, i.e. recreate hash table ($\Theta(M + n)$)

# \textbf{Closed addressing}: each entry in the hash table can hold more than one KVP (bucket)
## Can use unordered linked list (chaining)
## Average bucket size/chain length = $\alpha$
## Thus search has average-case $\Theta(1 + \alpha)$, worst-case $\Theta(n)$

# \textbf{Opening addressing}: if collision occurs, search linearly until a slot is available
## $h(k, i) = h(k) + i \text{ mod } M$
## Must distinguish between \underline{empty} and \underline{deleted} slots

# \textbf{Double hashing}:
## $h(k, i) = h_1(k) + h_2(k)i \text{ mod } M$

# \textbf{Cuckoo hashing}: always insert new element at $h_1(k)$
## If collision, kick out old element and re-insert at $h_2(k)$
## Repeat for at most $n$ times; rehash if exceeds $n$ times
## Any particular element is guaranteed to be at either $h_1(k)$ or $h_2(k)$

\end{easylist}
\subsection*{Multi-Dimensional Data}
\begineasylist

# \textbf{Range search}: return all elements within a certain range of values
## Nodes are either \emph{boundary}, \emph{inside}, or \emph{outside} based on the \underline{paths from root to the left} \underline{\& right boundary values}
## One-dimensional range search = $O(\log n + k)$ for $k$ reported elements

# \textbf{Quad trees}: divide elements into 4 quadrants until each quadrant contains only 1 element
## Each node has 4 children representing 4 quadrants
## \textbf{Spread factor} = $\beta = \dfrac{d_{max}}{d_{min}}$, where $d_{max/min}$ = max/min distance between 2 points
## Height $= h \in \Theta(\log \beta)$
## Range search $\in \Theta(nh)$

# \textbf{kd-trees}: split elements into 2 equal regions until each region contains only 1 element
## Sort by x-coordinate; divide elements by median
### Median is stored at root; elements with x $\leq$[$>$] median go in left[right] subtree
## Sort each subset by y-coordinate; repeat; alternate sorting between x- and y-coord
## Height = $h \in \Theta(\log n)$
## Rnage search $\in O(k + \sqrt n)$

# \textbf{Range trees}:
## Construct $T$ w.r.t. x-coords
## Every node in $T$ has an associated tree $T_{assoc}$ of its subtree in $T$ w.r.t. to y-coords
## Range search:
### Perform 1D range search on $T$ w.r.t. x-coords
### For outside nodes, do nothing
### For boundary nodes, check individually
### For inside nodes that are immediate children of boundary nodes, perform 1D range search on their $T_{assoc}$ w.r.t. y-coords
### Time complexity $\in O(k + \log^2 n)$
### Space complexity $\in O(n \log n)$

\end{easylist}
\subsection*{String Matching}
\begineasylist

# Given a text $T$ of length $n$ and a pattern/word $P$ of length $m$, we try to find the first $i$ such that $P[j] = T[i + j]$ for $0 \leq j \leq m - 1$

# Brute-force $\in \Theta(mn)$

# Deterministic finite automata
## Matching time $\in \Theta(n)$
## Preprocessing time $\in O(m|\Sigma|)$

# \textbf{Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)}:
## Instead of shifting $P$ by 1 and re-checking every time $P$ is not matched (as in brute-force), shift $P$ to the next spot where \underline{at least some of $P$ is matched}
### How much to shift? Find the \underline{longest prefix that is a \textbf{strict} suffix}

## \textbf{Failure array}:
### $F[j] \leftarrow$ length of the longest strict suffix ($P[1..]$) that is a prefix ($P[0..]$)
### $F[0] = 0$ always
### $F[j-1]$ gives the index in $P$ to start checking again after a failed match
#### Everything before that index is known to match, due to it being the longest prefix that is a suffix
### $\in O(m)$

## Matching using the failure array:
### If match succeeds, move to next position in $T$ and $P$
### If match fails at first position ($T[i] \neq P[0]$), just try next position ($i+1$
### If match fails at $j > 0$, stay at the same place in $T$ and start checking at $P[F[j-1]]$
### \underline{Alternative method:} each time, shift $P$ forward by $j - F[j]$
### $\in O(n)$

# \textbf{Boyer-Moore}:
## Check match \underline{right-to-left}, starting with last character in $P$

## \textbf{Bad character heuristic}:
### Suppose match fails at $T[i] = c$
#### If $c \in P$, shift $P$ forward to align the last occurrence of $c$ in $P$ with $T[i]$
#### If $c \notin P$, shift $P$ past $c$ to align $P[0]$ with $T[i+1]$
### \textbf{Last-occurrence function}:
#### For each $c$ in $\Sigma$, $L(c)$ = largest index of $c$ in $P$, or -1 if $c \notin P$

## \textbf{Good suffix heuristic}:
### Suppose $P[j..m] = t$ (a suffix of $P$) is matched, but fails at $P[j-1] = c$
### Shift $P$ forward to align the last occurrence of $t$ in $P$ in the same location
#### Or if $t$ doesn't exist, align the longest suffix of $t$ that is a prefix of $P$
#### Or if no suffix exists, shift $P$ past $t$ completely (like in bad character)

### \textbf{Suffix skip array}:
#### $S[i] \leftarrow$ largest $j$ such that $P[i+1..m-1] = P[j+1..j+m-1-i]$ and $P[i] \neq P[j]$
#### $S[i]$ gives the index \underline{before} the last occurrence of $t$ \underline{not prefixed by $c$} in $P$
#### If $t \in P$, extend the indices into negatives by prepending $P$ to itself, but \underline{overlapping the longest prefix that's a suffix}

## On mismatch, choose the one that provides a bigger jump
### Shift the end of $P$ to index = $i + m - 1 - min(L(T[i], S[j])$
### i.e. shift $P$ forward by $1 - max(L(T[i], S[j])$

## Worst case $\in O(n + |\Sigma|)$

# \textbf{Rabin-Karp Fingerprint}
## Allow a substring of the length of $P$ ($m$) to be hashed as a number
## At every position in $T$, hash the $m$ digits at that location and compare with the hash of $P$ ($\Theta(1)$)
### If hash does not match, move to next position
### If hash matches, check for match linearly ($\Theta(m)$))
### Rolling hash: assume $h(t) = t \mod k$
#### Only hash the first position fully (e.g. $h(abcde)$)
#### At subsequent positions, (this is $\Theta(1)$)
\[ h(bcdef) = (h(abcde) - a \times (10^5 \mod k)) \times 10 + e \mod k \] 

# \textbf{Suffix trees}:
## If multiple patterns are searched for in $T$, preprocess $T$ instead
## Store all suffixes of $T$ terminated by end-of-string character (\$) in a trie
## Compress trie into a tree:
### Each node holds the length of substring generated by the path from root to it
### Also holds $l,r$ such that the node's substring corresponds to $T[l..r]$
#### If node is a leaf, $r = n - 1$ (goes to the end of $T$)
#### Otherwise, $T[l..r]$ is the first occurrence of the substring in $T$
### There are $n + 1$ leaves, with $[0, n] \ldots [n, n]$ 
## Only need to find a prefix in the tree
